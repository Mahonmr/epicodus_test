#Ping Pong

###By: Mike Mahoney

Ping Pong is a sample JavaScript Application for demonstrating basic proficiency in JavaScript,
Jquery, Git, Markdown, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and BDD.

A user enters a number and is shown a range of numbers from 1 to the number entered with the
following execptions:

* Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "Ping"
* Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "Pong"
* Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "PingPong"

##Testing

I used the BDD tool "Jasmine" version 2.3.4 for my testing. To run my  
tests, simple type jasmine outside of spec directory.

##Installation

My app was built using the Precompiled Bootstrap framework (version v3.3.5)  
After installing the ping pong app, start the server by typing "jekyll serve"    
on the command line. Next, go to your browser and type in the server address    
"http://127.0.0.1:4000". The ping pong app will be up and running ready to crunch    
some numbers.
